Initially, you will create a Bean which uses the low-level Client API.

Create a POJO to parse the JSON response into a Java object:

[source,groovy]
.src/main/groovy/example/micronaut/BintrayPackage.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/groovy/example/micronaut/BintrayPackage.groovy[]
----

Create `BintrayLowLevelClient`:

[source,groovy]
.src/main/groovy/example/micronaut/BintrayLowLevelClient.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/groovy/example/micronaut/BintrayLowLevelClient.groovy[]
----

<1> Use `javax.inject.Singleton` to designate a class a a singleton.
<2>  Inject `RxClient` via constructor injection
<3> Inject the previously defined configuration parameters.
<4> Creating HTTP Requests is easy thanks to Micronautâ€™s fluid API.
<5> Use `retrieve` to perform an HTTP request for the given request object and convert the full HTTP response's body into the specified type. e.g. `List<BintrayPackage>`.
<6> The `retrieve` method returns a Flowable which has a `firstElement` method that returns the first emitted item or nothing

NOTE: Instead of `retrieve` we could have used `jsonStream`. You can use `jsonStream()` to stream arrays of type `application/json` or
JSON streams of type `application/x-json-stream`. If we use `retrieve`, such as in the previous code listing, the operation will not block.
However, it will not return until all the data has been received from the server. In the case of a JSON array that would be the whole array.
However, if you are interested in just the first element of the array, `jsonStream` provides a better alternative since it starts streaming data from the server without needing the whole response.
For example, `jsonStream().firstElement()` will only parse the first item in a JSON array. Hence it is more efficient.
